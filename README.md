# MPP-regressor-and-classifier
In this project, we trained a model to regress the mpp (Microns Per Pixel
) value of patches on HE-stained breast tissue WSI. According to relevant research, visual foundation models trained on a specific mpp, such as UNI, will perform better on test data with a similar mpp to their training data.
